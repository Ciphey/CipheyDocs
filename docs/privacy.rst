How do I know you're not taking the plaintext and storing it?
==========================================================
Valid concerns, but here are multiple ways to make sure we aren't taking your plaintext and storing it somewhere.
1. Read the source code on GitHub
2. Read the source code of the file you downloaded
3. Use Burp Suite to look at what is being sent to us
4. Use Wireshark to do the same
5. Understand we are 2 university students and this is being ran off of a GitHub Education Pack plan. We literally do not have the resources to do anything bad.
6. If we did store the plaintext, and our university found out, we will lose our degrees and that's scary.
7. Checksums
8. We have no interest in the plaintext it's not useful to us at all.
9. If you are still paranoid you can copy and paste the file, and open a GitHub issue with it.
10. We're mentors / president / on commitee of many cyber security organisations. If we did something this stupid, not only would we lose our degree but all credability.

# The Settings File

The settings file contains settings for Ciphey. Specifically, some of these you may want:
* REGEX list. Have a list of REGEX's for the REGEX checker? Use the settings file.
* Default language. Hate how Ciphey always loads in English? Use the settings file to change the default language to whatever you want.
* Is the language checker not working how you want it to work? Fine-tune the details in the settings file.

## Default settings file
Save this as settings.yml in the appdirs location, which can be found by running ciphey -where or --where.

```shell
        âžœ python3 ciphey -where    
        settings.yml should be placed in /home/bee/.config/ciphey
```

From this example, we can see that using the argument we need to place the settings file at /home/bee.config/ciphey/settings.yml

The settings file follows a specific format. **Copy and paste this below!**
```yaml

        # The language checking options. Basically, this detects plaintext.

regexFile:         
        # Put your custom REGEX here
        # These 4 REGEX's cover the most popular CTF flag formats.
        # {.*} means "any text of any size here" and /i means "ignore case".
        # For example, for the CTf NoobCTF the format would be /NoobCTF{.*}/i
        - /HTB{.*}/i # TODO HTB strings are just md5s
        - /THM{.*}/i
        - /FLAG{*.}/i
        - /CTF{*.}/i
```

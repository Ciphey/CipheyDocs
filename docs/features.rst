Features
==========

* 20+ encryptions supported <ciphers.rst>`click here for the full list`.
* Advance cipher targetting system, making use of artifical intelligence and common sense. 
Are you sick of artifical intelligence bloating everything? We only use it when it is **absolutely necessary**. The common sense part is important. If we see a string like "010100010100000111" we assume it is binary.
* Custom built natural language processing module(s). 
Language Checker checks to see if the given text is plaintext. We do this either with the Brandon checker (the default checker), the deep neural network, or regex. 
* Regex checker
If you have text you know is plaintext, such as _HTB{e563d8ae4b557d21060bfeb2a06d5cb2}_ but clearly won't be picked up as a language, use the regex checker.
* Multi language support
Also to note, Ciphey's default checker, Brandon, has multi language support and currently supports English & German.
* C++ Core -Ciphey has a C++ core for cryptanalysis tidbits. Python is very slow, but C++ is very fast. By offloading the bruteforcing of the program, we saw speed increases such as Caesar Cipher's 30% speed increase.
* Supports Hashes & Encryptions
Other online tools may only support encodings, hashes, or encryptions. Ciphey supports all of them! 
* Tweakable -Ciphey has a settings.yml file. This file lets you tweak the internal procedures of Ciphey. Want to use the German dictionary for phase 1 of language checker, and then the English dictionary? No worries! You can do that. Do you have a bunch of regexes, but hate inputting them manually? Store them in the settings file.
* Extensively tested with a lot of documentation -Everytime Ciphey goes for a release, it gets tested by many hand-written unit tests. And then, an automated testing system tests Ciphey 20,000 times over to make sure nothing breaks. 
* Not opionatedBase64 has an alternative syntax, but many online decoders don't make use of the alternative syntax. Opting to give you the most popular one. Thus, they are optionated. Ciphey strays from this as much as possible. We try not to hold an opinion on anything we don't need to. Alternative syntax is available for many modules, and is automatically tested against. No more worrying if Ciphey 
* Easy to contribute to. Want to add a new language? We have an easy to follow guide on this documentation. Want to add more decryption methods? Again, easy to follow guide. Ciphey is designed to be as modular as possible, so anyone wishing to contribute simply has to push their module and Ciphey will work with it.
* Built by the CTF community, for the CTF community. Ciphey was originally built for the Geocaching community, but is now built mainly for the CTF community. Although, it can be used by anyone. Cyclic3 & Brandon (core maintainers) are commitee members of the Liverpool Cyber Security Society. Both regularly attend CTFs and win some too. Brandon was #2 on the TryHackMe leaderboards. All code contributors or maintainers have been in CTFs, and we are all very active in the CTF community. Ciphey is built by the CTF community, for the CTF community.
